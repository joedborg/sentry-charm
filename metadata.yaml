maintainer: Joseph David BorÄ¡ <joseph.borg@canonical.com>
description: |
  The Sentry package fundamentally is just a simple server and web
  UI. It will handle authenticating clients (such as Raven) and all
  of the logic behind storage and aggregation.

  That said, Sentry is not limited to Python. The primary
  implementation is in Python, but it contains a full API
  for sending events from any language, in any application.
